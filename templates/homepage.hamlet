                    <p>
                        Deliver top quality value out of markov chain generated official studies.
                        We avoid fake news by thoroughly vetting all studies with an algorithm.
                        The algorithm is kept in a lockbox for maximum security.

                        The goal here is to come up with a site that tests the bounds of what people will believe.
