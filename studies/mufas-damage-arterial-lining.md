# MUFAs Damage Arterial Lining

## Abstract

Investigation into the Meditteranian diet have consistently shown
increased risk of cardiac events relative to the Standard American
Diet. Prior research has investigated the potential negative impact of
higher vegetable intake. However, no sufficiently strong causative
factors have been found.

Instead, we investigated the significantly higher levels of harmful
Mono-Unsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs) in the Mediterrannian diet
relative to the lower levels in the Standard American Diet.

## Methods

A randomized controlled study of 56,432 participants randomly assigned
to one of 4 groups:

1. Regular Meditteraniann diet (MD), consisting of 40% calories from
   MUFAs
2. Regular Standard American Diet (SAD), consisting of 10% calories
   from MUFAs
3. High-MUFA Standard American Diet (SAD), consisting of 40% calories
   from MUFAs. This was created by pouring olive oil into their french
   fries.
4. Low carb diet, consisting of 2% calories from carbs. As expected,
   all participants in this group died.

Following a 23 year follow up period, we assessed rates of cardiac
events in the various groups.

## Findings

As anticipated, participants in groups (1) and (2) had standard rates
of cardiac events for their respective diets, with the SAD diet of
course resulting in low rates of heart attack, stroke, and
diabetes. The high-MUFA SAD group, by contrast, had significantly
elevated rates of heart attack.

## Recommendations

No one should use olive oil under any circumstances. It will kill you.

## Conflicts of interest

None
